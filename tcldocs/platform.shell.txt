SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
       The  platform::shell  package  provides several utility commands useful
       for the identification of the architecture of a specific Tcl shell.

       This package allows the identification of the architecture  of  a  spe‐
       cific  Tcl shell different from the shell running the package. The only
       requirement is that the other shell (identified by its path), is	 actu‐
       ally executable on the current machine.

       While  for most platform this means that the architecture of the inter‐
       rogated shell is identical to the architecture  of  the	running	 shell
       this  is	 not generally true. A counter example are all platforms which
       have 32 and 64 bit variants and where a 64bit system  is	 able  to  run
       32bit code. For these running and interrogated shell may have different
       32/64 bit settings and thus different identifiers.

       For applications like a code repository it is important to identify the
       architecture  of	 the shell which will actually run the installed pack‐
       ages, versus the architecture of the shell running the repository soft‐
       ware.

COMMANDS
       platform::shell::identify shell
	      This command does the same identification as platform::identify,
	      for the specified Tcl shell, in contrast to the running shell.

       platform::shell::generic shell
	      This command does the same identification as  platform::generic,
	      for the specified Tcl shell, in contrast to the running shell.

       platform::shell::platform shell
	      This  command returns the contents of tcl_platform(platform) for
	      the specified Tcl shell.
