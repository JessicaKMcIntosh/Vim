NAME
       cd - Change working directory

SYNOPSIS
       cd ?dirName?
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
       Change  the current working directory to dirName, or to the home direc-
       tory (as specified in the HOME environment variable) if dirName is  not
       given.   Returns an empty string.  Note that the current working direc-
       tory is a per-process resource; the  cd  command  changes  the  working
       directory  for  all  interpreters  and  (in a threaded environment) all
       threads.

EXAMPLES
       Change to the home directory of the user fred:
              cd ~fred

       Change to the directory lib that is a sibling directory of the  current
       one:
              cd ../lib
