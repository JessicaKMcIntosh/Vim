Vim scripts I have written or modified.
These are under either the original copyright or the public domain.

Files:
    color/jessica.vim   - Custom color format. Close to old Vim colors.

    compiler/nagelfar.vim
**** This now lives at https://github.com/JessicaKMcIntosh/Nagelfar-Vim ****
                        - Use Nagelfar as a compiler command for checking Tcl
                          syntax.  Works best if g:nagelfar_file is set to the
                          full path of the nagelfar.tcl file. Works correctly
                          in Windows if tclsh is in the path.

    compiler/perlcritic.vim
                        - Compiler plugin for checking Perl code with perlcritic.
                          To use excute ':compiler perlcritic' them use ':make'
                          or ':lmake'. See ':help make' in Vim for details.

    indent/awk.vim      - AWK indention file adapted from the Perl indention
                          file. The default AWK indention file was overly
                          complex and didn't work correctly.

    syntax/perl.vim     - Changes to the default perl.vim.

                          Added more operators.
                          Made whitespace at the end of a line an error.

    syntax/screen.vim   - The start of a more complete screen syntax file.

    syntax/sh.vim       - The standard sh.vim with embedded AWK syntax.

    syntax/sql.vim      - More complete SQL syntax. Catches errors and
                          only highlights types inside create table
                          statements.

    syntax/tcl.vim      - Heavily reworked Tcl syntax file.
                          A work in progress.
                          See the Note at the top of the file regarding the
                          color of procedure names.

    plugin/emacskeys.vim
                        - Emacs like keymappings for insert mode.
                          This is so I can use familiar Bash Emacs mappings in Vim.

    plugin/pulse.vim    - Pulse the cursor line when repeating a search with
                          "n" or "N". See the file for details.

    plugin/securemodelines.vim
                        - Modification to the securemodelines.vim plugin to
                          allow more marker settings. The original does not
                          allow setting foldmarker or foldlevel.

    plugin/tcl_tooltips.vim
**** This now lives at https://github.com/JessicaKMcIntosh/TagmaTips ****
                        - Provides Tool Tips for Tcl code. Contains lists for
                          Tcl commands and variables. Will also scan the
                          current buffer for procedures adding the definition
                          and description comments. I am going to make this a
                          generic plugin with support for other languages.

    plugin/tcldocs.vim  - Lookup TCL documentation.
                          Requires the tcldocs directory.
                          Typing '\td' will lookup the word under the cursor or
                          highlighted word. Typing '\TD' will ask for a word to
                          lookup. If the word can not be found 'tcl' is loaded.

    tcldocs/            - Doc files for plugin/tcldocs.vim.
                          To generate the doc files for your Tcl environment see
                          the gen.sh script in the directory.
