Vim scripts I have written or modified.
These are under either the original copyright or the public domain.

Files:
    color/lorance.vim   - Custom color format. Close to old Vim colors.
    syntax/sh.vim       - The standard sh.vim with embedded AWK syntax.
    syntax/sql.vim      - More complete SQL syntax. Catches errors and
                          only highlights types inside create table
                          statements.
    syntax/tcl.vim      - Heavily reworked Tcl syntax file.
                          A work in progress.
    plugin/tcldocs.vim  - Lookup TCL documentation.
                          Requires the tcldocs directory.
                          Typing '\td' will lookup the word under the cursor or
                          highlighted word. Typing '\TD' will ask for a word to
                          lookup. If the word can not be found 'tcl' is loaded.
    tcldocs/            - Doc files for plugin/tcldocs.vim.
