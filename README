Vim scripts I have written or modified.
These are under either the original copyright or the public domain.

Files:
    ./color/lorance.vim - Custom color format. Close to old Vim colors.
    ./syntax/sh.vim     - The standard sh.vim with embedded AWK syntax.
    ./syntax/sql.vim    - More complete SQL syntax. Catches errors and
                          only highlights types inside create table
                          statements.
    ./syntax/tcl.vim    - Heavily reworked Tcl syntax file.
                          A work in progress.
